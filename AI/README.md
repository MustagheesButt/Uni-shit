## Assignment 1 - Search Algos
- Tiles-in-place, Manhattan Distance and Euclidean Distance are available as heuristic functions in Best First Search. You can implement others and easily integerate them in the code.
- Iterative Deepening Depth First Search uses a default value for depth (does not takes input from user).

## Assignment 2 - TicTacToe with MiniMax (Alpha Beta Pruning)
- Does not give the choice to select a heuristic (or even uses one, IDK).
- Does not use a ply-depth.

## Assignment 3 - MNIST Digits Recognition (Multilayer Perceptron)
- JavaScript used to implement the neural network. `p5.js` for drawing.
- Uses Sigmoid as activation function and simple subtraction for error calculation (not hyperbolic tangent or mean squared error).
- On running, trains the neural network from start, and does not saves the weights for later use.

How to run:

1. Extract the `mnist.zip` file. OR [Download the original files](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and extract them inside the assignment 3 folder.
2. Run a web server, Apache (XAMPP) for example.
3. Put the folder in the relevent directory where the web server can find it (`htdocs` in case of Apache).
4. Open `index.html` in a web browser through localhost.

## Assignment 4 - Decision Tree Induction + Naive Bayes Classifier
Sadly skipped this one. :Pepehands:
