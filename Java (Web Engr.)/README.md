## Project
The project given at the end of the course. This one is an online stock (fake) trading platform, where users can buy and sell their stocks.

 - The stock prices are quoted from the [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) API (`dashboard.jsp`).
 - For the API, you may need to register a new key, if my key is not working anymore.
 - User registeration page was not implemented. It's still named as `register.html`. If you have time you can implement it in JSP, just like `login.jsp`.

## Labs
I did some labs, but none are worthy of uploading here. ez stuff.

## DFS & BFS
For learning some basic Java concepts, I implemented Depth First Search and Breadth First Search in Java.
