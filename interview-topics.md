## Basics (in order of importance)

### OOP

- how is polymorphism achieved? static vs dynamic (overloading vs overriding)
- interface, abstract class, virtual, pure virtual class, friend class (some of them are same things)
- composition vs aggregation
- why is composition preferred over inheritance? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance)
- does using composition instead of inheritance makes your code more testable? how/why?

### OOAD + Design Patterns

- (more common patterns) Factory, Observer, Adapter, Singleton
- (less known) Strategy, Decorator and more
- Low coupling/High cohesion
- SOLID principles (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtmFCcjEgEw)

### Database + SQL

### DSA

- Quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort and their run times
- Arrays, Linked Lists, Circular Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists, Stack, Heap (not the one in RAM)
- names of graph traversal algos

### Basic Programming

- Recursion
- goto statement (and why is it bad, see: https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html)

## Extras (to impress)

- microservices
- NoSQL databases like MongoDB
- MVC (diff b/w MVC, MVP, MVVM)
